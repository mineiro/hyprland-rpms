# hyprland-plugins

Fedora RPM packaging for `hyprland-plugins` (official Hyprland plugin bundle).

Current packaging target:

- upstream tag `v0.53.0` (last known compatible plugin family)

Current repository policy:

- Hyprland is shipped at `0.54.x`.
- `hyprland-plugins` remains intentionally paused until upstream publishes a
  `0.54.x`-compatible plugin release.
