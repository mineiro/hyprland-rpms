# hyprtoolkit

Starter packaging directory for `hyprtoolkit` in this monorepo.

Current status:
- starter spec added (adapted from the `solopasha/hyprlandRPM` baseline, but updated to target `0.5.3`)
- expected to be a prerequisite for newer `hyprpaper` releases (`0.8.x`)
- next step is local SRPM + mock validation against the `mineiro/hyprland` COPR dependency stack
